German fairytales



I built this for the final project of my german fairy tales elective. I asked my non-CS professor if I could build a coding project and he allowed it.  
It is a text-based choose your own adventure fairy tale, loosely based on Grimmian themes and with no gendered characters, so that anyone can self insert as the main character. 
The code is not perfect, from my baby programmer days but I do think it shows how much I love to code. This project was nominated for a departmental award for the best undergraduate project, I didn't win but I was still very proud to be nominated. 
Feel free to just run it on your machine, it will guide you through the process.
